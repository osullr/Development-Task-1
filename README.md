# Software Engineering

Task 1 Name: Lowest Common Ancestor
Description: To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a graph, that may be structured as a binary tree. The grading focus is on your test code.

Files: LowestCommonAncestor.java and LowestCommonAncestorTest.java


Task 2 Name: Lowest Common Ancestor 2
Description: To enhance your previous LCA solution, implementing as a branch that you must ultimately merge with your master branch, an implementation of LCA that can work for graphs structured in directed acyclic form. 

Files: DAG.java and DAGTest.java


Task 3 Name: Biography of an influential software engineer
Description: To produce a short (2-4 page) biography of a key software engineer, discussing the work and impact of the individual.

Task 4 Name: Measuring Engineering - a report
Description: To deliver a report that considers the ways in which the software engineering process can be measured and assesed in terms of measurable data, an overview of the computationial platforms available to perform this work, the algorithmic approachs available, and the ethics concerns surrounding this kind of analytics.

Task 4 (Github Access) and Task 5 (Social Graph)
Descriptions:	
Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer.

Interrogate the GitHub API to build visualisation of data available tht elucidates some aspect of the softare engineering process, such as a social graph of developers and projects, or a visualisation of indiviudal of team performance. Provide a visualisation of this using the d3js library
